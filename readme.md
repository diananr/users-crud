# Users CRUD

This is an entry level project that aims to test research capabilities, React.js fundamentals, working with collections
and problems resolution.

You are given two folders, one contains a simple API that exposes a single endpoint named */users* which returns a json with users dummy data. The other folder contains a client scaffold created with [react-create-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can refer to its documentation to work with everything in there.

The idea is that the client side application consumes users from the API and from there creates a client side CRUD that won't persist the data.

Technologies that must be used to develop this project are:
* React.js

Apart from that you are free to choose what technologies to use. Some recommendations include Lodash.js and the Fetch API.

You'll be given further instructions through the trello associated with this project. Request access with a pm.

Good luck![GitHub](http://github.com)
